# A source code library with Chan FAT FS

This project provides a convenient way to integrate the
[Chan FAT FS](http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html)
into the xpm/npm ecosystem, by allowing to install it as a package dependency.

The open-source project is hosted on GitHub as
[xpacks/chan-fatfs](https://github.com/xpacks/chan-fatfs).

## Install

As a source code library, this project can be integrated into another project
in the traditional way,
by either copying the relevant files into the target project, or by linking
the entire project as a Git submodule.

However, things can be further automated and the most convenient way is
to **add it as a dependency** to the project via **xpm**.

### Install with xpm/npm

Along with the source files, this project also includes a
`package.json` file with the metadata that allows it to be identified as an
**xpm/npm** package so that it can be directly installed from GitHub.

#### Prerequisites

A recent [xpm](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/),
which is a portable [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) command line application
that complements [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com)
with several extra features specific to
**C/C++ projects**.

It is recommended to install/update to the latest version with:

```sh
npm install --global xpm@latest
```

For details please follow the instructions in the
[xPack install](https://xpack.github.io/install/) page.

@warning
Be sure **xpm** is not installed with administrative rights.

#### xpm

This project can be installed as a package from GitHub with:

```sh
cd my-project
xpm init # Unless a package.json is already present

xpm install github:xpacks/chan-fatfs

ls -l xpacks/@xpacks/chan-fatfs
```

#### npm

The package can also be installed with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com)
or related, but
the features specific to C/C++ projects will not be available;
therefore, at least for consistency reasons, it is recommended
to use **xpm**.

### Add as Git submodule

Besides manually copying the relevant files to the target
project, which will later require extra maintenance efforts to keep the
project up to date, a more convenient
solution is to link the entire project as a **Git submodule**,
for example below an `xpacks` folder:

```sh
cd my-project
git init # Unless already a Git project
mkdir -p xpacks

git submodule add https://github.com/xpacks/chan-fatfs.git \
  xpacks/@xpacks/chan-fatfs
```

## Branches

In addition to the original `main` branch, there are two
xPack specific branches:

- `xpack`, with the latest stable version (default)
- `xpack-develop`, with the current development version

All development is done in the `xpack-develop` branch, and contributions via
Pull Requests should be directed to this branch.

When new releases are published, the `xpack-develop` branch is merged
into `xpack`.

When there are new upstream releases:

- upstream `master` is merged into the local `master`
- the local `master` is merged into `xpack-develop`
- the project is tested
- `xpack-develop` is merged into `xpack`
